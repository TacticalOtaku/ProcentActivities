# Procent Activities

**Procent Activities** is a Foundry VTT module that allows you to apply percentage-based damage or healing effects to items, compatible with the D&D 5e system, Midi QOL, and Dynamic Active Effects (DAE). It provides a user-friendly GUI for configuring these effects directly on item sheets.

## Features

- **Percentage-Based Effects**: Apply damage or healing as a percentage of a target's current or maximum HP.
- **GUI Configuration**: Add a `%` button to item sheets (visible in edit mode) to configure percentage effects.
- **Access Control**: Restrict configuration access to Game Masters (GM) or allow all players via a global setting.
- **Midi QOL Integration**: Seamlessly apply percentage effects during Midi QOL workflows.
- **DAE Support**: Configure percentage effects as active effects via DAE macros.
- **Customizable**: Choose between current or max HP as the base, set the percentage, and allow/disallow overlimit effects.

## Compatibility

- **Foundry VTT**: Minimum version 12, verified up to 12.331.
- **System**: D&D 5e (minimum 4.2.0, verified 4.2.2).

## Usage

### Configuring Percentage Effects
1. Open an item sheet (e.g., weapon, spell, equipment, consumable, tool, loot, or feature) in **edit mode**.
2. Look for the `%` button in the header (next to other control icons).
3. Click the `%` button to open the configuration form.
4. Set the following options:
   - **HP Base**: Choose between "Current HP" or "Maximum HP".
   - **Action Type**: Select "Damage" or "Healing".
   - **Percentage (%)**: Enter the percentage value (e.g., 75 for 75%).
   - **Allow Overlimit**: Check to allow percentages above 100%.
5. Click **Save** to apply the settings.

### Applying Effects
- When the item is used in a Midi QOL workflow, the module will automatically calculate and apply the percentage-based damage or healing to the target.
- If using DAE, the effect will be applied as a macro when the active effect triggers.

### Module Settings
1. Go to **Configure Settings â†’ Module Settings â†’ Procent Activities**.
2. Configure the **Access Restriction** setting (only available to GMs):
   - **Game Master Only**: Only GMs can see and use the `%` button on item sheets.
   - **All Players**: All players can configure percentage effects.
